## Primary Data Source
The primary data for this project were obtained from the Emergency Events Database [(EM-DAT)](https://www.emdat.be/). Information regarding the country, city, date, total number of people affected, total number of deaths, etc. for various types of natural disasters during the period 1920-2021 are selected. In addition, natural disasters that do not affect the public, such as mudslides that occur in deep forests, are excluded.

## Work Allocation
In order to better complete this project, our team assigned the tasks in details after determining the topic, met regularly to summarize and help each other solve problems. A more detailed allocation of duties is as follows.

#### Junmo Qu
Layout and construction of the webpage, the interactive quiz, the Tremendous Damage section's data visualizations, and narratives for the Tremendous Damage and Call to action section.

#### Shuhe Jiang
Timeline and Geo Location distribution visualizations for the Wide Impact section, presentation, and video recording.

#### Zheyi Li
Exploratory data analysis, the first interactive data visualization in the Wide Impact section, and the data visualization in the Call to action section.

#### Weiyuan Zhang
Exploratory data analysis, the Psychological Injuries section's data visualizations and narratives.

For other tasks such as writing reports, we divided them equally.

## Commentary
The whole cooperation process was relatively smooth, thanks to our meticulous planning. During this process, there were some difficulties in how to import the interactive visualizations into the online webpage, how to embed the visualizations into the final webpage, and the logic of the storytelling. After continuous discussions and attempts, we finally overcame these difficulties and completed this project. It is a very memorable and fulfilling experience for our whole group.
