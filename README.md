## Abstract
**Introduction** 
Natural disasters caused millions of casualties and global economy suffers great loss every year. We aim to create an interactive website that visualize natural disasters occurred in the past 50 years in order to help people know more about different catastrophes and call to action. 

**Dataset** 
We visualized the natural disaster dataset from CRED. The dataset contains 14643 observations of 17 variables that records global catastrophes  since 1970. 

**Methods** 
We used data visualization tools (Flourish and Tableau) together with Plotly and matplotlib packages in R and Python to visualize our data which followed by a web page construction utilizing Shorthand.

**Results** 
101.8 million people were affected by natural disasters in 2021 and the total economic loss in 2021 is 270 billion dollars. Among all catastrophes, earthquake, flood and storm are the top three disasters that cause the most economic loss. Also, all three disasters have worldwide effects, and essentially every country suffers from them. Among 18500 evacuees of Tokyo earthquake 2011, 14.6% in 2011, 11.7% in 2012, and 10.3% in 2013 screened positive for high distress, and 21.6% in 2011, 17.4% in 2012, and 17.2% in 2013 had probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

**Conclusion** 
Natural disasters bring not only physical casualties and economic loss but also mental issues to millions of people around the world every year. Nevertheless, people can learn from past disaster with our website for better disaster prediction, post-disaster management and reconstruction in the future.

## Primary Data Source
The primary data for this project were obtained from the Emergency Events Database [(EM-DAT)](https://www.emdat.be/). Information regarding the country, city, date, total number of people affected, total number of deaths, etc. for various types of natural disasters during the period 1920-2021 are selected. In addition, natural disasters that do not affect the public, such as mudslides that occur in deep forests, are excluded.

## Work Allocation
In order to better complete this project, our team assigned the tasks in details after determining the topic, met regularly to summarize and help each other solve problems. A more detailed allocation of duties is as follows.

#### Junmo Qu
Layout and construction of the webpage, the interactive quiz, the Tremendous Damage section's data visualizations, and narratives for the Tremendous Damage and Call to action section.

#### Shuhe Jiang
Timeline and Geo Location distribution visualizations for the Wide Impact section, presentation, and video recording.

#### Zheyi Li
Exploratory data analysis, the first interactive data visualization in the Wide Impact section, and the data visualization in the Call to action section.

#### Weiyuan Zhang
Exploratory data analysis, the Psychological Injuries section's data visualizations and narratives.

For other tasks such as writing reports, we divided them equally.

## Commentary
The whole cooperation process was relatively smooth, thanks to our meticulous planning. During this process, there were some difficulties in how to import the interactive visualizations into the online webpage, how to embed the visualizations into the final webpage, and the logic of the storytelling. After continuous discussions and attempts, we finally overcame these difficulties and completed this project. It is a very memorable and fulfilling experience for our whole group.
